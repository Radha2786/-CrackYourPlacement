//Heap Condition = it should be complete binary tree
//complete binary tree = if a tree has height h (to h-1 tak completely filled hona chahiye)
// last level m left to right filled hona chahiye
//har ek node par ek priority lga hoga

// to find parent index = ci-1/2
// to find out the child = left: 2*pi+1 & right: 2*pi+2
//to make Heap we use ArrayList and simultaneouly check with parent for min/max condition
